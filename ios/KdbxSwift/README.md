# KdbxSwift

A cut-down KDBX file handling library. This can't be used for general purpose KDBX file reading and writing but it offers the essentials that Kee Vault Ltd requires in order for us to integrate our KDBX file with an iOS autofill app extension.

## License

Much of the code within is copyright KeePassium and used under GPL3 license (see below). As with all Kee Vault Ltd open source software, the library itself is released under our AGPL3 license.
