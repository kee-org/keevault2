* Changing biometric settings no longer requires signing in again
* A message is displayed when an attempt to use biometrics fail (e.g. when it is time to re-enter your main password periodically)
* Cancelling a file export no longer displays a spurious "Exported" message
* Fixed an incidental background crash after AutoFill completes
* Improved reliability by upgrading our code to use the latest version of Flutter
