* There is now a free version of the app which requires no subscription! More details will be published soon at https://forum.kee.pm/t/kee-vault-2-is-free/3749
* Improved fingerprint authentication feature:- option for how often you'll be asked for your master password instead (defaults to 60 days); option for how often you'll have to verify that it is you operating your device (defaults to 60 seconds); if you authenticate yourself to your phone and then open Kee Vault quickly enough, you don't have to authenticate again with Kee Vault
* Small file attachements can now be added to entries
* Entries can store and display a Time-based One Time Password (a common type of additional authentication for services)
* Entry history can be reviewed and an entry can be reverted to an old version if required
* Fixed several bugs, improved performance of some parts of the app and upgraded Flutter
